## 🧬 HematoVision – AI-Based Blood Cell Image Classifier

**HematoVision** is a lightweight, intelligent web application designed to classify blood cells using deep learning techniques. It empowers medical practitioners, lab technicians, and researchers with quick diagnostics by analyzing microscopic images of blood samples.

---

### 🎯 Mission

Enable fast, AI-assisted detection of white blood cell types from images to support blood-related diagnostics and research.

---



## 📸 How It Works

🖼️ Users upload an image of a white blood cell.

🤖 The AI model (based on MobileNetV2 and TensorFlow) classifies the cell as one of:

* **Eosinophil**
* **Lymphocyte**
* **Monocyte**
* **Neutrophil**

✅ The model returns an **instant prediction** along with the displayed image, enabling rapid analysis.
